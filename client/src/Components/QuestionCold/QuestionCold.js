                    <h2> What's the difference between a cold and the flu?</h2>
                    <p>
                        These illnesses are caused by different viruses. They have similar symptoms, so it can be hard to tell them apart. In general, cold symptoms are much milder than flu symptoms.

                        The symptoms of a cold include things like:

                        Sore throat
                        Stuffy nose
                        Runny nose
                        Cough
                        Mild fever
                        The flu, on the other hand, often causes higher fever, chills, body aches, and fatigue.

                <div className="questionCold__question">
                    <h2> Could my cold symptoms actually be allergies?</h2>
                    <p>
                        It's possible, if you're sniffling but not achy or feverish.

                        Also, if your symptoms last longer than 2 weeks, and you also have red, itchy eyes, it might be allergies.

                        But it's often hard to tell the difference because people with allergies and asthma are more likely to get colds. They may already have inflamed and irritated lungs, so they're less able to fight off a virus.

                    <h2> What's the best treatment for a cold?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The most important thing you can do is drink a lot of fluids to keep your body hydrated. This will help prevent another infection from setting in.

                        Avoid drinks with caffeine like coffee, tea, and colas. They may rob your body of fluids. When it comes to food, follow your appetite. If you're not really hungry, try simple things like white rice or broth.

                        Chicken soup is comforting, plus the steam helps break up nasal congestion. Ginger seems to settle an upset stomach. A hot toddy may help you sleep, but be careful about drinking alcohol if you also take cold remedies.

                    <h2> Should I get an antibiotic?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Antibiotics fight bacteria, but that won't help your cold, which is caused by a virus.

                        But your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic if you have some complications. For instance, if your sinuses are blocked and can't drain properly, you can get inflammation and a bacterial infection. The symptoms may be a runny or stuffy nose, pain and pressure in your face, and a headache.

                        Also, you can sometimes get an ear infection after a cold, and you might need antibiotics to treat it. Symptoms include ear pain, fever, or a feeling of fullness in the ears.

                    <h2> Should I stay at home if I have a cold?</h2>
                    <p>
                        You're contagious for the first few days of your cold, so it's best to stay home then. You need to be careful about coughing and sneezing around other people. Also, you will get better quicker if you get some rest.

                    <h2> How can I prevent a cold?</h2>
                    <p>
                        To protect yourself and prevent the spread of cold and flu viruses:

                        Wash your hands frequently with soap and water. If you don't have that nearby, use an alcohol-based gel.
                        Cough and sneeze into a tissue.
                        No tissue? When you cough, turn your head away from others.
                        If you have a sudden sneeze, bend your arm and sneeze into it.
                        Don't touch your eyes, nose, or mouth.
                        Wash any shared surfaces, like phones and keyboards, frequently. Viruses can live on surfaces for several hours.
                        Stay away from crowds during cold and flu season.

                    <h2> Why does my child always seem to have a cold</h2>
                    <p>
                        Kids are incredibly good at passing around a virus. They naturally breathe out more highly concentrated virus droplets than adults do.

                        As every parent knows, children are very active, always in each other's faces. And of course, they may not wash their hands as often or as well as grown-ups.
