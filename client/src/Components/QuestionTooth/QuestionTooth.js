                    <h2> Can Toothache Cause Headache?</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are a variety of dental conditions that can cause a headache:

                        Teeth Grinding – when you grind your teeth, it puts excessive pressure on one or both of your jaw joints. Prolonged tooth grinding can lead to severe headaches.
                        Referred Pain – sometimes, pain that arises from a tooth can be referred to the head, causing headaches.
                        Nervous Problems – this is a condition characterized by the irritation in one of the trigeminal nerve branches – the nerve that gives sensation to our teeth, jaws, and the head.

                    <h2> Can Toothache Cause Ear Ache?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Yes, it is possible, in the form of referred pain. Referred pain means that the pain is actually arising from any other part of the body (in this case, your teeth). However, your body perceives it to be coming from your ears. Referred pain arises in organs that have a common nerve supply.

                    <h2>Will Toothache Go Away?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Whatever the reason behind a toothache, it will go away as soon as the underlying cause is removed. For example, toothache caused due to tooth sensitivity goes away as soon as you finish your cold or sweet food and drinks.

                        Similarly, if something is stuck between your teeth, it will go away as soon as you remove it. Moreover, dental pain because of an underlying infection normally goes away after taking pain medication.

                        However, in advanced stages, when the dental pulp has become irreversibly inflamed, painkillers are not effective. The only solution in this situation is root canal treatment. If your dentist feels that the damaged tooth cannot be saved, they recommend getting the tooth extracted.

                    <h2> How Long Does Wisdom Tooth Growing Pains Last?</h2>
                    <p>
                        You may feel pain when your wisdom teeth are piercing through the teeth gums and erupting in the oral cavity. The duration of wisdom tooth growth varies with each person.

                        The pain will go away as soon as the tooth becomes visible in the oral cavity. The wisdom teeth growth pain may get prolonged if there is a complication in its eruption, such as when one of the teeth get impacted or when there is insufficient space for complete tooth eruption. You may use warm water, or salt water gargles to reduce the swelling in the region.

                    <h2> What Causes A Throbbing Tooth Pain That Comes And Goes?</h2>
                    <p>
                        If you have a throbbing type of pain in one of your teeth that gradually increases in intensity, it may be an abscess. An abscess is a pus-filled cavity lesion that forms around the tooth’s root due to a dental infection. One of the initial signs of a dental abscess is a throbbing pain that doesn’t go away, even after taking pain medication.

                        Toothache, in most cases like tooth decay, gum disease or teeth sensitive to hot or cold drinks, can be easily avoided if we simply maintain optimal oral hygiene.

                        Moreover, you should never take dental pain lightly. If the pain does not go away after taking pain medication, you should immediately seek expert dental care! A toothache might be an indication of a more severe underlying dental problem that required emergency dental treatment.
