                    <p>
                        The food we eat goes into our stomach through the esophagus. The gastric glands in your stomach create acid, which is necessary to digest the food. When the gastric glands create more acid than needed for the digestion process, you can feel a burning sensation below the breastbone. This condition is commonly known as acidity.

                    <h2> Home remedies for acidity</h2>
                    <p>
                        Acidity is a common problem that most of us face at least once in our life. Most of us prefer home remedies over medications. Some of the home remedies for acid reflux include the following.

                        1. Coconut water: This tasty treat is known to soothe your stomach and the digestive system. Take at least two glasses a day.
                        2. Watermelon juice: It is great to counter acidity. You can take a glass of watermelon juice with breakfast.
                        3. Fresh lime juice that is taken at least an hour before lunch helps to reduce the uneasiness caused by acidity.
                        4. A glass of buttermilk after a spicy meal helps reduce the uneasiness as buttermilk contains lactic acid that normalises acidity in the stomach
                        5. You can either munch on a few basil leaves, or boil them in water and drink it frequently to reduce acid reflux. You can also do this with mint leaves.
                        6. Drink a glass of lukewarm water after every meal
                        7. Include banana, cucumber and yoghurt in your diet. They are known to give instant relief from acidity.
                        8. Ginger aids in digestion. Use ginger in your cooking or boil it in a glass of water, reduce to half glass and consume the water.
                        9. Cumin is a great remedy for acidity. Munch on some cumin or boil a teaspoon of cumin in a glass of water. Boil until the water is reduced to half. Drink it on an empty stomach.
                        10. Try chewing gum! As unbelievable as it may sound, chewing gum generates saliva that helps to move the food through the oesophagus.
                        11. Take a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar with a glass of water every morning on an empty stomach.
                        12. Drink at least two litres of water every day
